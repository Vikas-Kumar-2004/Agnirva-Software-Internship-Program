### **10. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

If you encounter any problems while running the application, try the following solutions:

- **Events Not Loading or Showing Errors**:
  - **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure your device is connected to the internet.
  - **API Endpoint Changes**:
    - NASA's EONET API endpoint might have changed. Verify the API URL in the code or check [NASA's EONET API Documentation](https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/) for updates.
  
- **Markers Not Appearing on the Map**:
  - **Incorrect API Response**:
    - The API might not be returning data in the expected format. Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) to check for any JavaScript errors.
  - **Event Categories Mapping**:
    - Ensure that the category mappings in the code match the current category IDs from the EONET API. Categories may be updated or changed over time.

- **Styling Issues**:
  - **External Resources Not Loading**:
    - The application relies on external URLs for Leaflet's CSS and JavaScript. Ensure your internet connection is active.
    - If the map or styles aren't loading, try refreshing the page or checking your internet connection.

- **Browser Compatibility**:
  - **Outdated Browser**:
    - Ensure you are using an up-to-date version of your web browser for the best experience.
  - **JavaScript Disabled**:
    - The application uses JavaScript to fetch and display data. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.

- **Date Input Issues**:
  - **Invalid Date Range**:
    - Ensure that the number of past days entered does not exceed the API's limits (if any) and is within the allowed range (1-365).
