### 6. **Obtain a NASA API Key (Optional but Recommended)**

The provided code uses NASA's `DEMO_KEY`, which has limited usage rates. To ensure uninterrupted access and higher rate limits, it's advisable to obtain your own API key.

1. **Visit NASA's API Portal**:
   - Go to [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/) using your web browser.

2. **Sign Up for an API Key**:
   - Click on **"Sign Up"**.
   - Fill in the required information, such as your name and email address.
   - Submit the form to receive your unique API key via email.

3. **Update the Code with Your API Key**:
   - Open the `nasa_apod.html` file in your text editor.
   - Locate the line:
     ```javascript
     const AgnirvaapiKey = 'DEMO_KEY'; // Your NASA API key
     ```
   - Replace `'DEMO_KEY'` with your unique API key. For example:
     ```javascript
     const AgnirvaapiKey = 'YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY_HERE';
     ```
   - **Save** the changes (`Ctrl+S` on Windows or `Command+S` on Mac).

*If you choose not to obtain your own API key, you can continue using the `DEMO_KEY`. However, be aware that it may have rate limits, meaning you can only make a certain number of requests within a given time frame.*
