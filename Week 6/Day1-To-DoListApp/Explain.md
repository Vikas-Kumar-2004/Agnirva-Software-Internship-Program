This code creates a simple website where you can keep track of your tasks in a to-do list. It allows you to add tasks, edit them, delete them, and see them listed on the page. The tasks you add are saved directly in your browser, so even if you close the site or refresh the page, the tasks you’ve entered will still be there when you come back.

The top part of the page has a form where you can add a task. In the form, there are fields where you type the title of the task, the category (like “Homework” or “Chores”), select the priority of the task (High, Medium, or Low), and choose the deadline for when the task should be done. There’s also a button to save the task after filling in all the details.

Below the form, there’s a table where all your tasks are displayed. Each row in the table shows one task, including the title, category, priority, and deadline. For each task in the list, there are two buttons: one to edit the task and another to delete it.

The website uses a piece of code called JavaScript to make all of this work. When you type something in the form and click the save button, the JavaScript collects the information you entered and adds it to a list of tasks. If you’ve edited an existing task, it updates the task instead of adding a new one. It then saves this list in your browser’s memory, so the tasks don’t disappear when you leave the page.

If you click the edit button next to a task, the form at the top gets filled with the task’s current details, so you can change anything you want. When you save it again, the task gets updated in the list. If you click the delete button, the task is removed from the list completely.

The JavaScript also updates the table whenever there’s a change. For example, if you add, edit, or delete a task, the table is cleared and rebuilt to show the updated list of tasks. It’s like refreshing the list every time something changes, but it happens instantly, so you don’t even notice.

Everything you add is stored in a special part of your browser called localStorage. This is like a small notebook your browser uses to keep track of information, even if you close it. So, when you visit the page again, the code checks this notebook, reads all the tasks you saved before, and shows them on the table again.

To make the page look nice, there’s some styling code. This styling changes things like the font, colors, and spacing. For example, the form and table have rounded corners and shadows to make them look cleaner and more modern. The buttons are also styled so they’re easy to recognize: the edit button is orange, the delete button is red, and the save button is green.

In short, the code combines input fields for adding tasks, a table for displaying them, buttons for managing the tasks, and browser storage to keep everything safe. It’s a simple, interactive to-do list that remembers what you’ve added until you decide to clear it.
