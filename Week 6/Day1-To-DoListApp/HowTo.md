To run this code, follow these step-by-step instructions. Don’t worry if you’ve never done anything like this before—this guide will break everything down for you in very simple terms.

1. **Get a Computer**  
   Make sure you have a computer or laptop with an internet browser installed, like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. You don’t need any special software other than a text editor and your browser.

2. **Open a Text Editor**  
   A text editor is a program where you can write or edit text files. The easiest one to use is Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac.

   - On **Windows**: Click the Start button, search for "Notepad," and open it.  
   - On **Mac**: Open the Finder, search for "TextEdit," and open it. (If you’re on Mac, go to "Format" in the menu and select "Make Plain Text" to ensure you're working with plain text.)

3. **Copy the Code**  
   Copy all the code provided (starting from `<!DOCTYPE html>` all the way to the end of `</html>`). To copy, highlight the text, right-click on it, and choose "Copy" (or press `Ctrl+C` on Windows or `Command+C` on Mac).

4. **Paste the Code into the Text Editor**  
   Go to your text editor, right-click anywhere in the blank space, and choose "Paste" (or press `Ctrl+V` on Windows or `Command+V` on Mac). This will paste the code into the editor.

5. **Save the File as an HTML File**  
   Now you need to save the file in a way that the browser can understand. 

   - On **Windows**: 
     1. Click "File" at the top left, then click "Save As."
     2. Choose a location like the Desktop so you can find it easily later.
     3. In the "File name" box, type `todo_list.html` (make sure it ends with `.html`).
     4. In the "Save as type" dropdown, select "All Files" instead of "Text Documents."
     5. Click "Save."
   - On **Mac**: 
     1. Click "File" in the menu bar, then "Save."
     2. Choose a location, like the Desktop.
     3. Name the file `todo_list.html` (make sure it ends with `.html`).
     4. Make sure the format is set to "Plain Text" or similar.
     5. Click "Save."

6. **Open the File in Your Browser**  
   Find the file you just saved on your computer (e.g., on your Desktop).  
   - Double-click the file, and it will open in your default browser (like Chrome or Edge).  
   - If it doesn’t open, right-click the file, select "Open With," and choose your browser.

7. **Use the To-Do List**  
   Once the file opens in the browser, you’ll see a simple webpage with a title that says "My To-Do List," a form to enter tasks, and a table to display your tasks.  
   - Type the details of a task into the form, like the title, category, priority, and deadline.  
   - Click the green "Add Task" button to save the task.  
   - The task will appear in the table below the form.  
   - Use the "Edit" button to modify a task or the "Delete" button to remove it.

8. **Your Tasks Are Saved**  
   The webpage uses your browser to save tasks. This means even if you close the browser or shut down your computer, the tasks you entered will still be there when you reopen the file.

9. **To Access the To-Do List Again**  
   To use the to-do list later:
   - Go back to the file you saved (`todo_list.html`) and double-click it again to reopen it in the browser. All your tasks will still be there.

That’s it! You’ve just run a custom-made to-do list without needing any special tools or knowledge. If you want to share it with someone, you can email them the `todo_list.html` file, and they can follow the same steps to open it on their computer.
