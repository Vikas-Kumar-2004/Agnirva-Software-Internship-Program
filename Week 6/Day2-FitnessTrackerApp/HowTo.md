       - Click "Save."

5. **Open the File in a Browser**:
   - Find the file you just saved (e.g., on your Desktop). It will be named `fitness_tracker.html` and will likely have an icon resembling a browser or document.

     - Log activities by entering the details in the activity section.
     - Filter and view activities using the dropdown menus.
     - See progress bars for goals and a chart of weekly activities.

7. **Save Your Work**:
   - This application uses the browser’s local storage, which means everything you add is automatically saved on your computer. You don’t need to press a "Save" button.
   - However, the data will only be available on the same browser and device where you ran the app.

8. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - If the application is not displaying correctly or you want to share it with someone else:
