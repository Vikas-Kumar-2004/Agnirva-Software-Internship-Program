To run this code and see how it works, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Copy the Code**:
   - Highlight the entire code starting from `<html>` to `</html>`.
   - Right-click on the selected code and choose "Copy" or press `Ctrl+C` (on Windows) or `Cmd+C` (on Mac) to copy it.

2. **Open a Text Editor**:
   - On your computer, open a simple text editor where you can paste the code. For Windows, you can use **Notepad**. On a Mac, you can use **TextEdit**. On Linux, you can use any text editor like Gedit.
   - If you're using Notepad or TextEdit, open it now.

3. **Paste the Code**:
   - Inside the text editor, right-click and choose "Paste" or press `Ctrl+V` (on Windows) or `Cmd+V` (on Mac) to paste the copied code into the editor.

4. **Save the File as an HTML File**:
   - Once the code is pasted, you need to save it with the correct file extension. This is very important so the browser knows it’s a web page.
   - In the text editor, click on "File" > "Save As."
   - A window will appear asking you where to save the file. Choose a location you can easily access, like your desktop.
   - In the "File Name" field, type `hotel-booking.html`.
   - For **Notepad**:
     - Change the "Save as type" dropdown to "All Files."
   - For **TextEdit** (Mac users):
     - First, make sure you're in plain text mode by going to "Format" and selecting "Make Plain Text."
   - Finally, click "Save."

5. **Open the HTML File in a Browser**:
   - Go to the location where you saved the `hotel-booking.html` file (e.g., your desktop).
   - Double-click on the file. It will automatically open in your default web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).

6. **Interact with the Web Page**:
   - Once the page opens, you’ll see the "Mock Hotels" header at the top and a form for entering search details.
   - Use the form to:
     - Enter a location (e.g., "New York").
     - Choose check-in and check-out dates.
     - Select the number of guests.
     - Click the "Search" button to display the list of hotels.
   - Look at the available hotels, and if you want to book one, click the "Book" button below it.
   - A pop-up will appear asking for your name and email address. Fill in these details and confirm the booking.

7. **View and Manage Bookings**:
   - After confirming the booking, scroll down to the "My Bookings" section to see your confirmed bookings in a table.
   - If you want to clear all bookings, click the "Clear All Bookings" button. It will ask for confirmation before deleting everything.

8. **Revisit Later**:
   - If you close the browser and reopen the file later, your bookings will still be there because they are saved in the browser’s local storage. This storage works as long as you don’t clear your browser’s history or cache.

9. **Optional: Reload the Page**:
   - If you want to test how the page works from the beginning, press `F5` (on Windows) or `Cmd+R` (on Mac) to refresh the page.

This process requires no special software beyond a text editor and a web browser. By following these steps, anyone can run the code and interact with the mock hotel booking system.
