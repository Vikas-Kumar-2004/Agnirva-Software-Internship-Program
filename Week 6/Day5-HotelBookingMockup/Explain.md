This code creates a simple hotel booking website with a form that allows users to search for hotels, view the available ones, and make bookings. 

When you open the website, the page starts by showing a header with the title "Mock Hotels." Below the header, there’s a search section where you can enter the following information:
1. The location or city where you want to find a hotel.
2. The check-in and check-out dates for your stay.
3. The number of guests.

Once you fill in these details, you can click the "Search" button, which will display a list of hotels that match your location criteria. Each hotel shows its name, location, description, price per night, and an image. Below this, there's a "Book" button for each hotel. When you click the "Book" button, a pop-up window (called a modal) appears. In this window, you’re asked to enter your name and email address to complete the booking.

Once you confirm your booking, the system saves your booking information (hotel name, location, check-in and check-out dates, and number of guests) in the browser’s local storage. This means that even if you refresh the page, your booking will still be there. The booking information also gets displayed in a table below the search section, so you can see all your confirmed bookings.

There is also an option to clear all bookings by clicking the "Clear All Bookings" button. This will remove all saved bookings from both the table and the local storage, effectively clearing the history of your bookings.

The page also adapts to smaller screens, like mobile phones, by making the layout more compact. For example, the hotel cards are stacked vertically on smaller devices, and the search section becomes a vertical list instead of a row.

The script also handles filtering the available hotels based on the location you entered. If you type a city name in the search box, only the hotels located in or near that city will be displayed.

In terms of how it works behind the scenes, when you click the "Search" button, the JavaScript code collects the values you entered (location, check-in date, check-out date, and number of guests). It then filters through a predefined list of hotel data and shows only those hotels that match your search criteria. When you select a hotel and enter your details to confirm the booking, the data is stored in the browser's local storage and displayed in the booking table. 

The system is designed to work entirely in the browser, so there is no need for a server to process the data. Everything, from hotel data to bookings, is handled locally using JavaScript and stored in the browser’s local storage.
