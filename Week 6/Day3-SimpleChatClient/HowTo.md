Here’s a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to run this code. We'll break it down into simple instructions so that even if you’ve never worked with technology like this before, you can follow along.

### Step 1: Install Node.js
**Node.js** is a tool that lets your computer run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. You need this to run the chat program.

1. Open a web browser (like Chrome or Edge) on your computer.
2. Go to the Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
3. You’ll see two download buttons: "LTS" (recommended) and "Current." Click on the "LTS" button because it's the stable version.
4. Once the file finishes downloading, open it. It will usually be named something like `node-vxx.x.x.msi` (on Windows) or `node-vxx.x.x.pkg` (on Mac).
5. A setup wizard will open. Click **Next** and accept all the default options (you don’t need to change anything). When you see the option to install, click **Install**. Wait until the installation finishes.
6. To confirm that Node.js was installed, open a "terminal" or "command prompt":
   - On Windows: Press the **Windows Key**, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - On Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
7. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   node -v
   ```
   If it shows a version number (like `v18.17.1`), Node.js is successfully installed.

### Step 2: Create a File for the Code
You need to save the code in a file so the computer knows what to run.

1. Open a text editor:
   - On Windows, you can use **Notepad** (search for it in the Start Menu).
   - On Mac, you can use **TextEdit** (search for it in Spotlight).
2. Copy the entire code provided above.
3. Paste it into the text editor.
4. Save the file:
   - In the text editor, go to **File** > **Save As**.
   - Navigate to a folder where you want to save the file (e.g., "Documents").
   - Name the file `chat.js`. Make sure it ends with `.js`. (On Windows, select "All Files" as the file type to ensure it doesn’t save as `chat.js.txt`.)
   - Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Open the Terminal and Navigate to the File
The terminal is where you’ll run commands to start the chat program.

1. Open the terminal (like you did earlier).
2. Use a command to move into the folder where you saved the file. For example:
   - If you saved the file in the "Documents" folder, type:
     ```
     cd Documents
     ```
     and press Enter.
   - If it’s in another folder, replace `Documents` with the correct folder name.
3. To check if the file is there, type:
   ```
   dir
   ```
   (on Windows) or
   ```
   ls
   ```
   (on Mac) and press Enter. You should see `chat.js` listed.

### Step 4: Install the Required Library
The program needs a helper library called `ws` (WebSocket). You can install it using Node.js.

1. In the terminal, type this command:
   ```
   npm install ws
   ```
   and press Enter.
2. Wait for the installation to complete. You’ll see some messages about files being downloaded. When it’s done, you’ll be back at the prompt where you can type commands.

---

### Step 5: Start the Chat Program
1. In the terminal, type this command:
   ```
   node chat.js
   ```
   and press Enter.
2. If everything is correct, you’ll see a message like:
   ```
   Agnirva Chat server running at http://localhost:3000
   ```
   This means the chat program is now running on your computer.

---

### Step 6: Open the Chat in Your Browser
1. Open a web browser (like Chrome, Edge, or Safari).
2. In the address bar at the top, type:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   and press Enter.
3. The chat interface will load. It will ask for your username. Enter any name you like and click OK.
4. You’re now in the chat room! You can type messages, and if someone else connects to the same chat (by visiting the same link on their computer), you’ll be able to chat with them in real-time.

---

### Step 7: (Optional) Connect from Another Device
If you want to test this chat system with another person on the same network:
1. Find your computer’s IP address:
   - On Windows: Open the terminal and type `ipconfig`. Look for the line that says "IPv4 Address" under your active connection.
   - On Mac: Open the terminal and type `ifconfig | grep inet`. Look for a number like `192.168.x.x` under your active connection.
2. Share the address with your friend, replacing `localhost` with your IP address. For example:
   ```
   http://192.168.x.x:3000
   ```
3. When they visit this address in their browser, they’ll join the same chat room.

### Step 8: Stop the Chat Program
When you’re done chatting, go back to the terminal and press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server. This will shut down the chat program.

That’s it! You’ve successfully set up and run a real-time chat program. You can experiment with sending messages, joining from other devices, or even modifying the code if you want to add new features.
