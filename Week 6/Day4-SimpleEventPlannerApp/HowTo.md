To run this code, follow these steps precisely. This guide assumes no prior technical knowledge, so each step is explained in great detail.

1. **Open a Text Editor**:
   - Use a program to write and save code. The simplest option is *Notepad* on Windows or *TextEdit* on macOS.
   - On macOS, open TextEdit, then click **Format** in the top menu and select **Make Plain Text** so that the file can hold code.

2. **Copy the Code**:
   - Highlight the entire code provided above by clicking and dragging the cursor over it.
   - Right-click on the highlighted code and select **Copy**.

3. **Paste the Code into the Text Editor**:
   - Open the text editor and right-click inside the blank space.
   - Select **Paste** to insert the code into the editor.

4. **Save the File with the Correct Extension**:
   - Click **File** in the top-left corner of the editor and select **Save As**.
   - In the file name field, type `event_planner.html`.
   - In the **Save as type** dropdown menu (if available), select **All Files** or **HTML File**.
   - Make sure the file ends with `.html` (not `.txt` or anything else).
   - Choose a location where the file will be easy to find, like the desktop, and click **Save**.

5. **Open the File in a Web Browser**:
   - Locate the saved `event_planner.html` file on the desktop (or the folder where it was saved).
   - Right-click on the file and select **Open With**. Choose any web browser, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Safari.
   - The code will now open as a fully functioning webpage in the browser.

6. **Use the Event Planner**:
   - You’ll see a title at the top, a form to add events, and sections for searching and filtering.
   - Fill in the event details (title, date, and time) in the form and click the **Add Event** button.
   - The event will appear in the list below the form.
   - You can search for events using the search bar, filter them with the dropdown menu, or use the buttons next to each event to mark it as complete, edit it, delete it, or share it.

7. **Enable Notifications (Optional)**:
   - When the webpage is first opened, a message may appear asking for permission to send notifications.
   - Click **Allow** to enable notifications. This step is required for the event reminder feature to work.

8. **Keep the Browser Open**:
   - For notifications to work, the browser tab showing the event planner must remain open. If the tab is closed, reminders will not appear.

9. **Access Events Later**:
   - Events are stored directly in the browser’s memory (called `localStorage`). As long as the webpage is opened in the same browser on the same computer, the events will remain saved.
   - If the browser's data is cleared or the webpage is opened on a different computer or browser, the events will not appear.

By following these steps, the code will work exactly as intended without requiring any special software installation.
