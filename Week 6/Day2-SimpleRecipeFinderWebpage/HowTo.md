To run this code and see it working, you don’t need any fancy software or tools—just a computer with a web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) will do. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open a Text Editor**:  
   First, you need to copy the code into a program that allows you to write and save text. On Windows, you can use Notepad. On a Mac, you can use TextEdit (but make sure to switch to plain text mode). Other good options include any code editor like VS Code or Sublime Text, but a simple text editor is enough.

2. **Copy the Code**:  
   Highlight the entire code you have and copy it. You can do this by clicking and dragging your mouse over the text, then right-clicking and selecting "Copy," or by pressing `Ctrl + C` (or `Command + C` on Mac).

3. **Paste the Code**:  
   Open your text editor and paste the code into it. You can right-click and select "Paste" or press `Ctrl + V` (or `Command + V` on Mac).

4. **Save the File**:  
   Now, you need to save the file.  
   - Click on "File" in the menu and then "Save As."  
   - In the box that appears, give the file a name, like `recipe_finder.html`.  
   - Make sure to include the `.html` extension at the end of the file name.  
   - For the "Save as type," choose "All Files" if that option exists (on Notepad, for example).  
   - Save the file somewhere you can easily find it, like your Desktop.

5. **Open the File in a Browser**:  
   After saving the file, go to where you saved it (e.g., your Desktop). You should see the file named `recipe_finder.html` with an icon that looks like a browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).  
   - Double-click the file, and it will open in your default browser.  
   - If it doesn’t open, you can right-click the file, select "Open with," and then choose your browser.

6. **Use the Recipe Finder**:  
   Once the file opens in your browser, you’ll see the "Simple Recipe Finder" page.  
   - Type an ingredient into the search box, like "chicken."  
   - Click the "Search" button or press the Enter key on your keyboard.  
   - The page will start searching and show you recipes related to the ingredient you entered.

7. **Enjoy the Results**:  
   After a few seconds, you’ll see a list of recipes, each with a picture and name. If no recipes are found, you’ll see a message saying so. If something goes wrong, it will let you know to try again later.

8. **Troubleshooting**:  
   - If the page doesn’t work or shows errors, make sure your internet connection is active. This code relies on an online service (TheMealDB) to get recipe data, so it needs the internet.  
   - If you make changes to the code, save the file again and refresh the browser to see the updates.

That’s it! You’ve now run the code and created your very own recipe finder. It’s like having your mini-application, all powered by your browser. No programming knowledge is required—just follow these steps, and the magic will happen!
