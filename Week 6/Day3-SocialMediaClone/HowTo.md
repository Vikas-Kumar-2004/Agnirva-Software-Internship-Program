### 1. Install Python

Python is the programming language used to write this app. Installing Python on your computer is the first step because it allows your computer to understand and run the code.

#### Steps to Install Python:

1. **Go to the Python Website**:
   - Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
   - Type [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in the address bar and press Enter.

2. **Download Python**:
   - On the Python website, you’ll see a big yellow button labeled **“Download Python [version number]”**. Click it. The version number might look like “3.x.x” (e.g., “3.11.4”). This is the latest version of Python.
   - The website will automatically detect your computer’s operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and give you the correct file.

3. **Run the Installer**:
   - Once the download finishes, open the downloaded file. This will start the Python installer.

4. **Important Step: Add Python to PATH**:
   - Before clicking the **"Install Now"** button, look for a checkbox that says **"Add Python to PATH"** (usually at the bottom of the installer window). Make sure this box is checked. This step ensures that Python works properly when you run commands later.

5. **Install Python**:
   - After checking the box, click **“Install Now”**. The installer will set up Python on your computer.
   - Wait for the installation to complete. When it’s done, you’ll see a message saying **“Setup was successful”**.

6. **Verify Python Installation**:
   - Open the terminal on your computer:
     - **Windows**: Press the **Windows key**, type "Command Prompt," and press Enter.
     - **macOS**: Press `Command + Space`, type "Terminal," and press Enter.
     - **Linux**: Open the Terminal from the applications menu.
   - In the terminal, type the following command:
     ```
     python --version
     ```
   - If Python was installed successfully, you’ll see a message like:
     ```
     Python 3.x.x
     ```
   - This confirms Python is ready to use.

### 2. Install a Code Editor

A code editor is like a special text editor designed for writing and managing code. It helps organize and edit the files of the project.

#### Steps to Install a Code Editor:

1. **Go to the Visual Studio Code Website**:
   - Open your browser and go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Download Visual Studio Code**:
   - On the website, there’s a big button labeled **"Download for [your operating system]"** (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux). Click it. The website will automatically choose the correct version for your computer.

3. **Install Visual Studio Code**:
   - After the download finishes, open the installer file.
   - For Windows:
     - During installation, you may see options like **"Add to PATH"** or **"Install Code as a shell command"**. Make sure these options are checked, as they’ll make using the editor easier.
     - Click **Next** and then **Install** to finish the process.
   - For macOS/Linux:
     - Follow the instructions on the website, which may involve dragging the VS Code icon to your Applications folder or running a command in the terminal.

4. **Open Visual Studio Code**:
   - Once installed, open the program.
   - You’ll see a screen with options like "Get Started" or "Open a Folder." You don’t need to do anything here yet; just keep the program open for the next steps.

### 3. Download the Code

Downloading the code means creating and organizing the files needed to run the app. Each piece of the code provided earlier corresponds to a file that you need to create on your computer.

#### Steps to Download the Code:

1. **Create a Folder for the Project**:
   - Open your file explorer (Windows File Explorer, Finder on macOS, or your Linux file manager).
   - Navigate to a location where you want to store the app (e.g., Desktop or Documents).
   - Right-click and select **"New Folder"** (or a similar option). Name the folder `social_media_app`.

2. **Create Files in the Folder**:
   - Inside the `social_media_app` folder, create new files for each part of the code provided earlier. To do this:
     - Open Visual Studio Code.
     - Click **File > Open Folder**, and select the `social_media_app` folder.
     - Once the folder is open in VS Code, click **File > New File**.
     - Name the file as instructed (e.g., `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `base.html`, etc.).
     - Copy the corresponding code from the earlier instructions into the new file.
     - Save the file by clicking **File > Save** or pressing `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + S` (macOS).

3. **Organize the Files**:
   - Make sure the files are placed in the correct structure:
     - The `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files should be in the `social_media_app` folder.
     - Create a folder called `templates` inside the `social_media_app` folder. Save the HTML files (`base.html`, `index.html`, etc.) inside this folder.
     - Create another folder called `static` inside the `social_media_app` folder. Inside `static`, create a subfolder called `css`. Save the `style.css` file in the `css` folder.

The folder structure should look like this:

```
social_media_app/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── templates/
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── login.html
│   ├── profile.html
│   ├── register.html
│   └── upload.html
├── static/
    ├── css/
        └── style.css
```

### 4. **Open a Terminal**
- A terminal is used to run commands. 
- On Windows:
  - Press the **Windows key**, type "Command Prompt," and open it.
- On macOS:
  - Press `Command + Space`, type "Terminal," and open it.
- On Linux:
  - Open the Terminal from the applications menu.

---

### 5. **Navigate to the Project Folder**
- In the terminal, change the location to the `social_media_app` folder where the files were saved.
- Use the following commands:
  - For Windows: `cd path\to\social_media_app` (replace `path\to\` with the actual path to the folder, e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\social_media_app`).
  - For macOS/Linux: `cd /path/to/social_media_app` (replace `/path/to/` with the actual folder path).

---

### 6. **Create a Virtual Environment**
- A virtual environment keeps all the necessary tools for this project separate from other things on the computer.
- Run this command in the terminal:
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  ```
- After this, a new folder named `venv` will appear in the `social_media_app` folder.

---

### 7. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
- The virtual environment must be activated.
  - On Windows:
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
- After activation, the terminal prompt will show something like `(venv)` at the beginning.

---

### 8. **Install Required Libraries**
- Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all the libraries needed for the project.
- Run this command in the terminal:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- This command will download and install Flask, Flask-Login, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Werkzeug, and other necessary libraries.

---

### 9. **Set Up the Database**
- The app needs a database to store user accounts, posts, and comments.
- Run this command in the terminal:
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- The app will automatically create a database file called `instagram_clone.db` and set up some sample users, posts, and comments. It will also create an `uploads` folder inside the `static` folder for storing uploaded images.

---

### 10. **Run the App**
- Once the setup is complete, run the app again by typing:
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- You will see output in the terminal like `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

---

### 11. **Open the App in a Browser**
- Open a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and type `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` into the address bar.
- The app’s homepage will load, showing the posts and options to log in or register.

---

### 12. **Using the App**
- To test the app:
  - Register a new user account or use one of the dummy accounts (e.g., username: `alice`, password: `password`).
  - Log in with the account.
  - Upload an image by clicking on the "Upload" button.
  - View posts on the homepage and try liking or commenting on them.
  - Visit the profile page to see the posts you’ve uploaded.

---

### 13. **Stopping the App**
- To stop the app, go back to the terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

---

### 14. **Optional: Running the App Again Later**
- Any time the app needs to be run in the future:
  1. Open the terminal.
  2. Navigate to the `social_media_app` folder (`cd path/to/social_media_app`).
  3. Activate the virtual environment (`venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux).
  4. Run the app with `python app.py`.

By following these steps, the app will run smoothly, and its features can be explored.
