To run this code, follow these steps carefully. The explanation assumes the person has never worked with Python or programming before. Everything is explained step by step, with no prior knowledge assumed.

1. **Understand What You Need to Get Started**:
   - A computer with access to the internet.
   - Python installed on the computer. Python is a programming language used to run this code.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Open a web browser and search for "Download Python."
   - Click on the link that says “Download Python” (it is likely from python.org).
   - On the Python download page, download the version that matches your computer's operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - After downloading, run the installer. During installation:
     - On the first screen, make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH.” This is very important.
     - Click “Install Now” and let the installer finish. Once done, Python will be installed on the computer.

3. **Check if Python is Installed Correctly**:
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux):
     - On Windows: Press the `Windows` key, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
     - On macOS: Press `Command + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
     - On Linux: Use the system’s terminal application.
   - In the terminal, type `python --version` and press Enter.
   - If Python is installed correctly, it will show a version number (e.g., Python 3.10.7). If it doesn't, the installation might need to be redone.

4. **Prepare a Place to Save the Code**:
   - Open the file explorer and go to a folder where the code will be saved. For example, create a folder on the desktop named `Minesweeper`.
   - Open a text editor to write the code. Use Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS, but make sure it's in plain text mode), or any code editor like Visual Studio Code.
   - Copy the entire code from the explanation provided.
   - Paste it into the text editor.

5. **Save the Code as a Python File**:
   - In the text editor, click on “File” and then “Save As.”
   - Navigate to the `Minesweeper` folder created earlier.
   - Save the file with the name `minesweeper.py`. Make sure the file extension is `.py`. If it saves as `minesweeper.py.txt`, rename the file by removing `.txt`.

6. **Run the Code**:
   - Open the terminal again.
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where the code is saved:
     - For example, if the folder is on the desktop, type:
       ```
       cd Desktop/Minesweeper
       ```
     - Press Enter.
   - Once inside the folder, type the following command to run the program:
     ```
     python minesweeper.py
     ```
   - Press Enter. This will start the program.

7. **What Happens Next**:
   - A new window will open. This is the Minesweeper game.
   - You will see a grid of buttons. You can click on any button to start playing the game.
   - Follow the rules of Minesweeper to either win or lose the game.

8. **Troubleshooting (If Something Goes Wrong)**:
   - If the terminal says something like “python is not recognized,” it means Python isn’t installed correctly or wasn’t added to the system’s PATH. Repeat step 2 and ensure the “Add Python to PATH” checkbox is selected during installation.
   - If there is a typo in the code, the terminal will show an error. Go back to the text editor, carefully check the code, and fix any mistakes.
   - If nothing happens when clicking on buttons, ensure that the code was saved properly with the `.py` extension.

9. **Close the Game**:
   - When done playing, close the Minesweeper window by clicking the “X” at the top-right corner (or top-left corner on macOS/Linux).
   - The terminal will return to normal. To stop the terminal, simply close it.

By following these steps exactly, the Minesweeper game will run successfully. No prior knowledge is needed, and everything is handled step by step.
