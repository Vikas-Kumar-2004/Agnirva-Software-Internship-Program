### 2. **Open a Text Editor**
   - You need a place to paste the code. The simplest option is the default text editor on your computer:

     - On **Mac**, use **TextEdit**.
   - Open the editor:
     - For **Notepad**: Click the Start Menu, search for “Notepad,” and open it.

### 4. **Save the File**
   - Now you need to save the file with the right name and file extension:
     1. Click **File** in the top menu and select **Save As...**.
     2. Choose a location where you can easily find the file later, like the **Desktop**.
     3. In the **File Name** field, type: `notes.html`.
     4. IMPORTANT: If you're on Windows, change the "Save as type" dropdown to **All Files**. On Mac, make sure the file extension is `.html`, not `.txt`.
     5. Click **Save**.

### 5. **Open the File in a Browser**
   - Go to the location where you saved the file (e.g., Desktop).
   - Double-click the file `notes.html`. It will automatically open in your default web browser (like Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).

### 6. **Using the Notes App**
   - You’ll now see the Notes App open in your browser. Here’s how you can use it:
     1. **Add a New Note**:
        - In the “Add a New Note” section, type a title, some content, and tags (optional).
        - Click the **Add Note** button. Your note will appear in the list below.
     2. **Search for Notes**:
        - Use the search bar to type keywords. The list will instantly show matching notes.
     3. **View a Note**:
        - Click the **View** button on a note to see its full details in a pop-up.
     4. **Edit a Note**:
        - Click the **Edit** button to make changes to a note. After editing, click **Save Changes.**
     5. **Delete a Note**:
        - Click the **Delete** button to remove a note. Confirm the action in the pop-up.

### 7. **Closing and Reopening the App**
   - If you close the browser or the file, your notes will still be saved because the app stores them in your browser’s memory (called `localStorage`).
   - To reopen the app, just double-click the `notes.html` file again.

---

### 8. **Optional: Share the App**
   - If you want to share the app with someone else, send them the `notes.html` file via email or any other method. They can follow the same steps to open and use it.

That's it! You’ve successfully run and used a notes app without needing any special tools or programming knowledge.
